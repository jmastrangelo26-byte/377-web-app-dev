        <p>"Often cited as the Pride of Hanover. The Hanover High School Marching Band brings a sense of atmosphere and euphoria 
            to every game they play at, every parade they march in, and every school event they attend. Without them, Hanover High School
            would not have the same, ethusiastic Hawk Spirit that permeates its halls every day.</p>
            
        <p>Here, explore the culture of the HHSMB and feel like you are a part of the great organization, ensemble, and band family
            that it is!</p>
